         * thoroughly tested yet, and in any case it should be improved to try
         * and break lines on spaces instead of whereever. So it is probably
         * best not to rely on this specific functionality at this point.
         *
         *
         * The input string will be split on new line characters (``U'\n'``),
         * and the individual lines will be written into the lines parameter.
         *
         * If a maxWidth is set, a string longer than that will be split and the
         * remainder moved to a new line. **Currently, this doesn't consider
         * spaces and will break lines mid word,** so try not to rely on this
         * feature as it is now.
         *
         * If more lines were to be created than allowed by the maxLines parameter,
         * then the last line will be cut off and show an ellipsis to indicate
         * more text has been cut off.
         *
         * The accompanying height should be calculated by the caller. The font
         * size in the \ref CForge::FontStyle objects is specified in pixels.
         * This function here can't do that, as the spacing between the text
         * lines is not set here. Each line will be an individual CForge::TextLine
         * object.
         *
         * The returned width is that of the longest line created.

         * \param[out] lines    Pointer to a list where the individual text lines will be written into.
         * \param[in] maxWidth  The maximum width allowed for a single line before starting a new one.
         * \param[in] maxLines  The maximum number of lines.
